1. use a queue to store the (key, value) pair that we have found so far. 
2. the queue should be a linked list:
a. each time a new node comes into the queue, need to check:
    a.1 if the node has already in the queue, if so, move the node to the head of the queue. 
    a.2 if the node is not in the queue, push into the queue, and resize the queue.
b.
